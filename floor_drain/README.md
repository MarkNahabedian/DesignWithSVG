# Floor Drain -- Laundry Room

The floor of my laundry room is a poured concrete slab.  There is a
drain hole in case the clothes washer leaks.  The drain hole is meant
to have a metal cover, but that cover doesn't stay in place.  The
absence of a cover allows large objects to fall into the drain.

I want to design a new grate that will stay in place.

This is my second Shaper Origin design that is based on a Pluto
Notebook and Julia insteead of my previous JavaScript designs.  I'm
still experimenting with this approach.
