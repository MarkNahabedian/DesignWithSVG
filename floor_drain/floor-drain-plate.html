    <h1>Floor Drain Cover for my Laundry Room</h1>

    <p>
      The floor of my laundry room is a poured concrete slab.  There
      is a drain hole in case the clothes washer leaks.  The drain
      hole is meant to have a metal cover, but that cover doesn't stay
      in place.  The absence of a cover allows large objects to fall
      into the drain.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to design a new grate that will stay in place.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I have a precise geometry in mind, I'd rather describe it
      in code than using a graphical user interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my previous designs for Shaper Origin were done using
      JavaScript to dynamically generate SVG code to a web page that
      renders the SVG and allows me to copy it to a file.  This
      approach was cumbersome though since I would need to edit the
      JavaScript code and reload the web page for each debug
      iteration.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is my second Shaper Origin design that is based on a Pluto
      Notebook and Julia, insteead of JavaScript.  I'm still
      experimenting with this approach, but, so far, I'm happy with it,
    </p>

      You can interact with the notebook on

      </a>.
      Warning: It takes severalminutes for the notebook to start up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the finished design
    </p>

      My plan was to use Shaper Origin to drill all of the holes and
      cut the outline.  I had a lot of trouble cutting though.  Maybe
      this was due to the $2.00 per pound junk yard aluminum sheet
      that seemed particularly gummy, or the 5 for $10.99 1/16 inch
      end mill bits from Amazon that left more metal as burrs than as
      chips.
    </p>

    <p>
      The aluminup sheet was 0.06 inch thick, clamped to a plywood
      spoilboard.  I cut the holes using "auto" mode, stepping the
      depth by 0.02, 0.02 and 0.03 inch.  I had to frequently break to
      sand off the burrs that were dragging against Shaper Origin's
      base.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cutting the perimeter was a lot harder.  Once again I used an
      initial depth of 0.02 inch.  Once again I needed to take
      frequent breaks (every half inch to an inch) to sand off burrs.
      I managed to complete a second pass at a depth of 0.04 inch.  I
      had a lot of trouble with the third pass though, with the Shaper
      Origin frequently retracting the spindle and displaying an error
      message that I was unable to read because the text was too
      faint and disappeared too soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several times during the whole process I changed the end mill
      bit because the flutes were clogging.
    </p>

    <p>
      I finished cutting the perimeter using a hack saw and file.

    <p>
      Though this project took more work than I expected, I'm
      satisfied with the result.
